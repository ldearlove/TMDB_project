## Overview

This repository contains the code for a movie data analysis project using The Movie Database (TMDB) data. This project demonstrates skills in Python, pandas, data visualization, and data analysis.

The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the TMDB dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizing key findings to uncover insights and trends within the movie industry.

## Contents

This repository contains:
* `TMDB_Liam_Final.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the final implementation of the data analysis and visualizations.
* `TMDB_Rough_Work.ipynb`: A notebook containing initial research, rough work, and exploratory data analysis.
* `TMDB_movies.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis, containing detailed information about movies from TMDB.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is TMDB_movies.csv, which includes various attributes of movies such as:
* Movie titles
* Release dates
* Genres
* Revenue
* Budget
* Ratings

## Methodology

The project involves several key steps:
1. Data Collection: The dataset is obtained from TMDB and loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data, handling missing values, and converting data types to prepare for analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of key features, investigating relationships between variables, and identifying trends over time.
4. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib to illustrate findings, including bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes detailed EDA and data visualizations to provide insights into the dataset. Various graphs and plots highlight key trends and patterns in the data, such as the correlation between movie budgets and revenue, movie genres with the highest revenue and a deeper look into the movies with the highest revenue-to-budget ratios.

## Usage

To explore the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Open the TMDB_Liam_Final.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and generate the analysis and visualizations.
